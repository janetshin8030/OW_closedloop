Basic File Writer Example - Data Recording with Event Markers

This example demonstrates how to record data to CSV files while capturing
event markers from keyboard input. This is essential for BCI experiments
where you need to save both neural signals and behavioral events for
offline analysis.

What this example shows:
- Generating synthetic EEG-like signals (8 channels)
- Capturing keyboard events as experimental markers
- Combining signal data with event markers using Router
- Real-time visualization with color-coded event markers
- Saving all data (signals + events) to CSV file with timestamps

Expected output:
- Real-time scope showing 8-channel signals with event markers
- CSV file 'example_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv' containing:
  * Column 1: Timestamp
  * Columns 1-8: Signal data from 8 channels
  * Column 9: Event markers (38=Up, 39=Right, 40=Down, 37=Left)
  * Automatic timestamp in filename prevents overwrites

Interactive controls:
- Arrow keys trigger colored markers in the display:
  * ↑ (Up): Red marker (value 38)
  * → (Right): Green marker (value 39)
  * ↓ (Down): Blue marker (value 40)
  * ← (Left): Black marker (value 37)

Real-world applications:
- BCI training data collection
- Event-related potential (ERP) experiments
- Motor imagery paradigm recording
- Behavioral experiment data logging
- Synchronizing neural and behavioral data

Technical details:
- Router combines 8 signal channels + 1 event channel = 9 total channels
- CsvWriter automatically adds timestamps to prevent file overwrites
- Keyboard node converts key presses to numerical event codes
- Markers appear on channel 8 in both display and saved file

Usage:
    python example_basic_file_writer_record.py
    Press arrow keys to create event markers
    Close window to stop recording
