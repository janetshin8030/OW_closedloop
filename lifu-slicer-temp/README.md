# SlicerOpenLIFU

Low intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) is a method of neuromodulation. This
uses ultrasound as a non-destructive treatment as opposed to using it for
imaging.

Build this extension by following [the usual procedure for Slicer
extensions](https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/extensions.html#build-an-extension).

   allow" to avoid repeated prompts.)

## Meshroom Setup (Optional)

This application is designed to work with different photogrammetry frameworks, such as the one included with [OpenLIFU 3D Scanner Android app](https://github.com/OpenwaterHealth/OpenLIFU-3DScanner). With credits in the app, computationally intensive tasks such as photogrammetric mesh reconstruction are performed in the cloud, eliminating the need for local Meshroom installation.

If you prefer to perform local mesh reconstruction locally instead of using cloud processing, you will need to install Meshroom and add it to your system PATH. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/OpenwaterHealth/OpenLIFU-python?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-meshroom) to download and configure Meshroom for local photoscan generation. Please ensure that you are downloading Meshroom 2025.1.0, as this is the most compatible version with most systems.

## Running Integration Tests with DVC (Optional)

SlicerOpenLIFU uses [DVC](https://dvc.org/) to manage test data stored in Google Drive. **Note:** Remote database access is currently restricted to authorized contributors.

### Running Tests

To run integration tests, you need a JSON service account key file for Google Drive access. Contact the developers to obtain `keyfile.json`.

Configure CMake with testing enabled and provide the key file path:
```bash
cmake -DBUILD_TESTING=ON -DDVC_GDRIVE_KEY_PATH=/path/to/keyfile.json ..
```

**Note:** The `DVC_GDRIVE_KEY_PATH` variable is only required when `BUILD_TESTING` is enabled.

Run tests from the build directory:
```bash
ctest -V -C Release
```
The test database (`db_dvc_slicertesting`) will be automatically downloaded to the repository directory when tests run.

### Updating Test Data

To commit changes to the test database, you need additional OAuth credentials. Contact developers for the `gdrive_client_secret`.

Download the latest test database:
```bash
git pull
dvc pull  # Requires service account key or OAuth authentication
```

Commit updates to the test database:

```bash
# Configure DVC for user authentication
dvc remote modify --local gdrive gdrive_client_secret
dvc remote modify --local gdrive gdrive_use_service_account false

# Update and push changes
dvc add db_dvc_slicertesting
git add db_dvc_slicertesting.dvc
git commit -m "Describe updates to test database"
git push
dvc push  # Requires user authentication; does not work with service account
```

To switch back to running tests:
```bash
dvc remote modify --local gdrive gdrive_use_service_account true
```
